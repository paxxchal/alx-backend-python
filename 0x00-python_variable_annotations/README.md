## Python Variable Annotations Project

This project explores the use of variable annotations in Python. It demonstrates good coding practices, type checking, and clear documentation.


### Technology Stack

* Python 3.7
* `pycodestyle` (version 2.5) for code style checking (optional)
* `mypy` for static type checking (optional)

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:** (assuming you have Git installed)
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/paxxchal/alx-backend-python.git
   cd 0x00-python_variable_annotations
   ```

### Running Tests (Optional)

If you have `mypy` installed, you can run type checking:

```bash
mypy src/*.py
```


### Contributing

Feel free to contribute by:

* Fixing bugs.
* Adding new features related to variable annotations.
* Improving documentation.
